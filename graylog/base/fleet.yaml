# Fleet configuration for Graylog base
# This file configures the base Graylog bundle
#
# NOTE: This base bundle should typically NOT be deployed directly.
# It's meant to be used by overlays (e.g., graylog/overlays/nprd-apps).
#
# If your GitRepo monitors graylog/base directly:
# - This bundle will be deployed to ALL clusters (unless you add cluster targeting)
# - Consider monitoring graylog/overlays/nprd-apps instead
#
# If your GitRepo monitors the root:
# - Fleet will create separate bundles for base and overlays
# - Overlays will use their own fleet.yaml for cluster targeting

defaultNamespace: managed-tools

# Uncomment below to prevent this base bundle from being deployed
# (only allow overlays to use it)
# targetCustomizations: []
