# Self-Signed ClusterIssuer for OpenSearch Bootstrap Webhook
#
# Creates a self-signed ClusterIssuer that can be used to generate
# TLS certificates for the webhook server.
#
# This ClusterIssuer generates self-signed certificates, which are
# suitable for internal webhook services.
#
# If you have a different issuer (Let's Encrypt, internal CA, etc.),
# you can use that instead by updating the issuerRef in
# opensearch-bootstrap-webhook-certificate.yaml
