# Graylog Index Configuration - Example Settings
#
# This file documents the recommended index rotation and retention settings
# that should be configured in Graylog web UI after deployment.
#
# To configure:
# 1. Log in to Graylog web UI at https://graylog.dataknife.net
# 2. Navigate to System → Indices
# 3. Configure the following settings:
#
# Index Rotation:
#   Strategy: Daily (rotate index every day at midnight UTC)
#   Max number of indices: 20 (14 days + 6 day buffer for safety)
#
# Index Retention:
#   Strategy: Delete indices after retention period
#   Max age: 14 days (2 weeks)
#   Action: Delete closed indices older than 14 days
#
# Index Configuration:
#   Shards per index: 1 (single node setup)
#   Replicas: 0 (single node setup)
#   Index optimization: After rotation (optimize after index is closed)
#
# These settings ensure:
# - 2 weeks of log retention (14 daily indices)
# - Efficient storage usage with daily rotation
# - Automatic cleanup of old indices
# - Headroom for growth (20 indices allows for 6 additional days buffer)
#
# Storage Calculation:
# - Base: 2 UniFi instances @ 250MB/day each = 500MB/day = 7GB for 14 days
# - With overhead: 7GB * 1.5 = ~10.5GB
# - Growth factor (20x): ~210GB
# - Recommended storage: 250GB (configured in graylog-helmchart.yaml)
