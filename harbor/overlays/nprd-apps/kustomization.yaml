  # Reference base kustomization directory
  # When Fleet monitors harbor/ and creates separate bundles, each bundle may only
  # have access to its own directory. However, Kustomize should resolve ../base/
  # relative to the kustomization.yaml file location within the git checkout.
  # If this doesn't work, the base and overlay may need to be in the same bundle.
