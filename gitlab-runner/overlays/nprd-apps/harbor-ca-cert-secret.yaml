# This file is not used - the Harbor CA certificate is extracted via script
# See: ./scripts/sync-harbor-ca-cert.sh
#
# The script extracts the CA certificate from Harbor's registry endpoint
# (which uses the default ingress certificate) and creates harbor-ca-cert
# secret in managed-cicd namespace for GitLab Runner job pods to use.
#
# Run the script to extract and create the certificate:
#   ./scripts/sync-harbor-ca-cert.sh
