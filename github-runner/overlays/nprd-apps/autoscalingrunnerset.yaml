  # Organization-level runner scale set
  # Available to all repositories in the organization
  # Runners are assigned to a runner group for access control
  githubConfigUrl: https://github.com/DataKnifeAI
  
  # Runner group name (must exist in GitHub org settings)
  # Create this group in: https://github.com/organizations/DataKnifeAI/settings/actions/runners
  # Configure it to allow "All repositories" or select specific repos
  # NOTE: Runner group must exist BEFORE creating this resource
  runnerGroup: NRPD Auto Scale
  
  # Runner scale set name (used in GitHub)
  # This appears as the runner name prefix in GitHub Actions
  runnerScaleSetName: nprd-autoscale-runners
  
  # Maximum number of runners that can be created
  maxRunners: 10
  
  # Minimum number of runners to maintain
  # Official ARC creates ephemeral runners, so this is the minimum idle runners
  minRunners: 2
  
  # Runner labels (optional)
  # IMPORTANT: Official ARC supports multiple labels!
  # This is different from community version which only supports one label
  labels:
    - self-hosted
    - kubernetes

  # Ephemeral runners are default in official ARC
  # They automatically clean up after job completion
  # This is built-in and doesn't need explicit configuration
