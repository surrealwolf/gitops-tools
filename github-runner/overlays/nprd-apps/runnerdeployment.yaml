      # Repository-level runner (attached to a specific repository)
      # Repository-level runners always have access to the repository
      # This avoids runner group access issues with organization-level runners
      repository: DataKnifeAI/gitops-tools
      
      # Alternative: Organization-level runner (available to all repos in org)
      # NOTE: Organization runners require runner group access configuration
      # If using org-level, ensure the repository has access to the runner group:
      # Settings > Actions > Runner groups > [Group Name] > Repository access
      # organization: DataKnifeAI
      # runnerGroup: default  # Optional: assign to a specific group
      
      # Alternative: Enterprise-level runner (available across enterprise)
      # enterprise: <YOUR_ENTERPRISE_NAME>
      
      # Runner labels (optional)
      # IMPORTANT: Actions Runner Controller does NOT support multiple labels
      # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/apply-labels
      # Use only a single label that matches your workflow's runs-on requirement

      # Environment variables (optional)
      # Note: RUNNER_NAME is set per-pod by ARC, don't override
      # This allows each runner to have a unique name
      
      # Ephemeral runners - clean up after job completion
      # This ensures runners don't accumulate and prevents replica buildup
      ephemeral: true
      
      # Note: registrationTimeout is not a valid field on RunnerDeployment
      # The timeout is managed by the controller (default 10m)
      # Ephemeral runners will help prevent the buildup issue
